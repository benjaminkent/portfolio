              My name is Benjamin Kent Jehl and I am a Full Stack Web Developer
              in the Tampa Bay area. A former Financial Advisor, I have recently
              followed my passion of the Tech Industry and learned the skills to
              write full stack web applications. I am passionate about creating
              beautiful, modern websites and enjoy the challenges that come with
              writing computer programs. As with this website, I tend to write
              all of the code myself from scratch, however I am familiar with
              and have implemented CSS frameworks like bootstrap and Bulma to
              create websites as well. I am extremely excited about where the
              tech industry is heading and look forward to the many challenges
              and breakthroughs that lie before us. Please reach out to learn if
              I would make a good fit for your Web Development team at: +1 (260)
